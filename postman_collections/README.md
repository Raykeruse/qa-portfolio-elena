# Postman Collection – API Testing Practice

This folder contains one of my first Postman API testing collections, created while following guided practice sessions.

Although built with guidance, this collection demonstrates my ability to:

- Structure API requests and organize them in collections
- Use variables and test multiple environments
- Write and run assertions using the built-in Postman test framework
- Validate:
  - Status codes (200, 400, 500)
  - JSON response structure and content
  - Presence and type of fields
  - Matching text and data ranges

## 🔧 Collection content:
- `Tests.postman_collection.json`:  
  Includes sample APIs from `petstore.swagger.io`, `chucknorris.io`, `rahulshettyacademy.com`, and others.

## 🛠️ Tools used:
- Postman v10.0+
- Basic scripting with JavaScript for test assertions

## 🎯 Next step:
Build my own Postman test cases from scratch and explore Newman for CLI testing and automation.
