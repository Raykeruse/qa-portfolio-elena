# Manual Test Cases

This folder contains manually written test cases for API testing tasks completed via [qa-playground.com](https://qa-playground.com).

Each test case includes:
- Clear preconditions and steps,
- Expected results,
- API details (URLs, headers, tokens),
- Tags and traceability to requirements.

## Included test cases

- [TC_001 – Deleting a user from the user list](TC_001_Delete_User.md)  
  *Positive test: confirms that a user can be successfully deleted via API.*

- [TC_002 – Deleting a user with an invalid UUID](TC_002_Delete_Invalid_UUID.md)  
  *Negative test: verifies correct error handling when deleting a non-existent user.*

---

These examples reflect both functional thinking and understanding of API structure. Future test cases will include UX-focused tests and edge scenarios.
